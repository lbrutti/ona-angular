    "introParagraphs": "<p class='intro__dek'>Rivers are complex water systems whose dynamics shape life on Earth as we know it. They are home to a wide range of freshwater species. They transport sediments and nutrients. They form wetlands, deltas, and floodplains which nurture flora, fauna, and human communities and protect us from natural disasters. They collect waters from the atmosphere and from the surface to replenish the groundwater systems which we depend upon for our survival. </p> <p class='intro__dek'>To provide all these fundamental ecosystemic actions rivers must be able to flow freely, moving unobstructed across multiple directions. Only a small fraction of the world’s watercourses however can do so: a myriad of human-made interventions tend to fragment, deviate, constrict, and regulate a river’s flow, dramatically impacting its functions and its surrounding ecosystems.  </p> <p class='intro__dek'>Understanding how rivers work and the threats they face is a first step in recognizing that restoring our watercourses is not only possible, but it is crucial.</p>",

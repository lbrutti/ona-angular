        "p1": " Rivers are complex systems whose dynamics shape life on Earth as we know it. They are home to a wide range of freshwater species. They transport sediments and nutrients. They form wetlands, deltas, and floodplains which nurture flora, fauna, and human communities and protect us from floods, droughts, and other natural disasters. They collect water from the atmosphere and land and replenish groundwater systems, which are key for our survival.",
        "p2": "To provide these essential ecosystem services, rivers must be able to flow freely, moving unobstructed in multiple directions. However, only a small fraction of the world’s rivers can still do so: a myriad of human-made works fragment, deviate, constrict, and regulate river flow, dramatically impacting natural functions and surrounding ecosystems."

Barriers block rivers’ longitudinal and lateral movements, fragmenting habitats and making entire portions inaccessible. For example, migratory fish might get cut off from their breeding areas, but even non-migratory fish species are impacted, as they can’t reach sheltered or nutrient-rich areas of the river that are critical to their survival.",
            "p4":"Fish get caught in dam turbines as they move downstream, or get stuck and disoriented as they move upstream and in reservoirs. In short, the negative impact of river fragmentation on the survival of fish species is great, and has been <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/rra.3386\" target=\"_blank\">documented and quantified</a>.",
            "p5":" Barriers also transform the physical and chemical characteristics of rivers and negatively impact a wide range of freshwater species. Sediments of different sizes, especially the coarser ones, get trapped, leading to riverbed erosion. The latter, together with the altered water flows due to barriers, is linked to more salty water from the sea penetrating the river. Such change in salinity affects species’ distribution, behavior, and limits the reproduction rate.",

Although they usually pose fewer problems to sediment transport, in some aspects, small hydropower schemes are more damaging than larger ones. They fragment river connectivity like larger dams while providing only a small contribution to energy demands. As most of them do not offer any storage and regulation capacity, they are strategically less valuable.
